## Email Sequences

### CareOwl - 3 Email Sequence

**Hook:** "CQC inspections don't have to be stressful - your compliance data should find itself"

**Email 1 - The CQC Pain Point**
```
Subject: [Home Name] - CQC prep question

Hi [First name],

I noticed you're the Registered Manager at [Home Name] - I imagine
you're juggling compliance, staffing, and resident care all at once.

Quick question: when CQC asks for evidence of staff training
compliance, how long does it take you to pull that together?

I've been working with care homes where the answer used to be
"hours of digging through folders and spreadsheets."

Now it's "30 seconds - here's the dashboard."

If getting CQC-ready reports at the click of a button sounds useful,
I'd love to show you how we do it.

Worth a 15-minute call?

[Signature]
```

**Email 2 (Day 3) - The Rating Recovery**
```
Subject: Re: [Home Name] - CQC prep question

Hi [First name],

Following up on my note about CQC compliance.

Quick story: a 40-bed residential home in [region] was struggling
with training record-keeping and staff compliance tracking.
CQC had flagged concerns.

After implementing our system:
- All staff training logged automatically
- Expiry alerts 30 days before certifications lapse
- CQC evidence packs generated in minutes
- Real-time compliance dashboard

They moved from "Requires Improvement" to "Good" at their next inspection.

Would 15 minutes be worth exploring if we could help [Home Name]
achieve something similar?

[Signature]
```

**Email 3 (Day 7) - Soft Close**
```
Subject: Probably not the right time

Hi [First name],

I know Registered Managers are pulled in a hundred directions -
I'll assume this isn't the right moment.

One thought to leave you with: the homes we work with typically
save 8-10 hours per week on compliance admin. That's time back
for what actually matters - your residents and staff.

Whenever you're ready to explore this, just reply.

Wishing you and the team at [Home Name] all the best.

### DispatchOwl - 3 Email Sequence

**Hook:** "Your warehouse ops are costing you hours per day - I've run these operations and built software to fix it"

**Email 1 - The Pattern Interrupt**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s warehouse

Hi [First name],

I noticed [Company] is running on Shopify with what looks like
your own warehouse operation - I used to run fulfillment for
[similar type of business] so I know exactly what that involves.

Here's what I'm curious about: how much time does your team spend
each day downloading orders, printing labels one-by-one, and
manually updating stock levels?

When I was in your shoes, it was about 3-4 hours daily.
Now I've built software that does it in minutes.

Would a 15-minute call be worth it to see if we could save you that time?

[Signature]
```

**Email 2 (Day 3) - The Proof**
```
Subject: Re: Quick question about [Company]'s warehouse

Hi [First name],

Following up - wanted to share something relevant.

A [product type] brand similar to [Company] was processing
200 orders/day with 2 full-time staff just on order admin.

After implementing our system:
- Order sync: Automatic from all channels
- Label printing: One click, bulk processed
- Inventory: Real-time across Shopify, Amazon, eBay

They're now handling 350 orders/day with the same team -
and zero picking errors.

Worth a quick chat to see if we could do something similar for [Company]?

[Signature]
```

**Email 3 (Day 7) - The Breakup**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First name],

I'll keep this brief - I've reached out a couple of times about
helping [Company] automate your warehouse operations.

I know you're busy running things, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

If you ever want to chat about getting those hours back, just reply
to this email - I'll still be here.

All the best with the Christmas rush!

### Route Forge - 3 Email Sequence

**Hook:** "Your drivers are choosing their own routes - and it's costing you 30% more than it should"

**Email 1 - The Fuel Cost Hook**
```
Subject: [Company]'s delivery routes

Hi [First name],

I saw that [Company] runs your own delivery fleet - I used to manage
a fleet of 12 vans doing local deliveries, so I know exactly what
that involves.

Quick question: are your drivers still choosing their own routes
each morning?

Industry data shows that's typically 30% less efficient than
optimized routing. On a 10-van fleet, that's often £2,000+ per
month in wasted fuel and driver time.

I've built route optimization software specifically for local
delivery operations - not the enterprise stuff that costs £50k,
but something that pays for itself in 2-3 months.

Worth a quick demo to see the potential savings?

[Signature]
```

**Email 2 (Day 3) - The Visibility Problem**
```
Subject: Re: [Company]'s delivery routes

Hi [First name],

Following up - wanted to ask about something else.

When a customer calls asking "where's my delivery?", can your team
answer that instantly? Or does someone have to call the driver?

The fleet I used to manage had the same problem. Customers frustrated,
office staff stressed, drivers interrupted mid-route.

Our system gives you real-time driver location, accurate ETAs you
can share with customers, and proof of delivery - all in one place.

One local courier company told me they cut customer service calls
by 60% in the first month.

Would 15 minutes be worth seeing how this could work for [Company]?

[Signature]
```

**Email 3 (Day 7) - The Capacity Question**
```
Subject: Probably caught you at a busy time

Hi [First name],

I'll keep this short - I know delivery operations don't stop for email.

One thing I've noticed: most fleet managers think they need more
drivers when actually they need better route planning.

When routes are optimized properly, the same drivers often handle
25-30% more stops per day.

If you ever want to see what your current capacity really is,
reply to this and I'll show you.

## Subject Line Best Practices

**Performance Benchmarks:**
| Metric | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Open Rate | 35-40% | 45%+ |
| Reply Rate | 4-6% | 8%+ |
| Meeting Booked | 1-2% | 3%+ |

**Best Practices:**
- 2-4 words performs best
- Personalization with name/company: +20-30% opens
- Question format increases engagement
- Avoid salesy language ("Free", "Offer", "Limited time")

---

## Technical Setup (Do First)

### Email Infrastructure

1. **Secondary Domain**
   - Use goowldigital.co or careowl.email
   - NEVER use main domain for cold outreach
   - Protects main domain reputation

2. **Email Authentication**
   - SPF record
   - DKIM signing
   - DMARC policy

3. **Domain Warm-up**
   - 2-3 weeks before campaigns
   - Start with 5-10 emails/day
   - Gradually increase to 30-50/day

4. **Volume Limits**
   - Max 30-50 emails/day per sending address
   - Use 3-5 sending addresses, rotate
   - Never blast hundreds at once

5. **Email Verification**
   - Verify ALL emails before sending
   - Target <2% bounce rate
   - High bounces = domain reputation damage

### GDPR Compliance (UK B2B)

B2B cold email is legal when:
1. You have "legitimate interest" (product genuinely solves their problem)
2. Include clear opt-out mechanism
3. Explain how you got their data
4. Contacting business email addresses
